# [RCDS](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/), Introduction to Deep Learning and convolutional neural networks in Python

In this course, we will go through the basics of PyTorch for computer vision (Torchvision), including handling images and existing data sets. We will train our own CNNs from scratch and use transfer learning to build on existing neural netoworks.
