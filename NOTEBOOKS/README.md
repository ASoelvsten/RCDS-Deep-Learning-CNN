# NOTEBOOKS 

This folder contains the Jupyter-notebooks that accompany the lecture series. Each notebook contains examples, exercises and external references. The first number in the name links the notebooks to the lectures (e.g., notebooks 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are related to lecture 2). Note that there are deliberately too much material so that you can pick and choose depending on your interest. The **essential notebooks** to address during the course are hence only **0.1, 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, and 3.1**.
